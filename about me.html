<h2><i>-Introduction-</i></h2>

<p> My name is Gaurang Soni, I am a student at GITAM University. I'm studying BBA. I am nineteen years old. </p>

<p> I'm trying to learn how to code and become a better programmer because I want to pivot to the IT sector. 
I think that IT is constantly developing and there is always something new that you can learn in this field. 
So, that is what I'm trying to do: experiment and learn about new technologies. And hopefully, one day, I too can contribute to this ever-growing field. </p>

<p> I studied computer science for my intermediate, and I'm doing some online learning too. So, I do have <i>some</i> experience with coding. I am familiar with Python and HTML (using which I made this website). </p>

<p> Other than computer science, I like reading novels, cooking pasta and listening to music. </p>
