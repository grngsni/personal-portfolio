<a style="background-color: #2f4222";><i><b> -Introduction- </b></i></a>

<p> My name is Gaurang Soni, I am nineteen years old. I'm a student at Gitam University, studying BBA.</p>
<p> I was born and raised in Visakhapatnam but my family is from Haryana. </p>

<a style="background-color: #2f4222";><i><b> -Education- </b></i></a>
<p> I completed my intermediate from <u>Timpany Senior Secondary School</u> with <u>CEC (Commerce, Economics, Computer Science)</u> in the year 2022, after which I took a gap year. </p>
<p>Currently, I'm doing my BBA, 1st year.</p>
<p>I'm fluent in English and Hindi. </p>
 

<hr>


<p> I'm trying to enhance my coding skills because I want to transition into the IT sector.  The dynamic nature and diversity of knowledge in the IT field motivates me to pursue a career in this field. My goal is to experiment and learn about new technologies, and hopefully contribute to this ever-growing field one day. </p>

<p> I studied computer science for my intermediate, and I'm doing some online learning too. So, I do have <i>some</i> experience with coding. I am familiar with Python and HTML (using which I made this website). </p>

<p> Besides computer science, I like reading novels, cooking pasta and listening to music. </p>
